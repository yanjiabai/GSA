# GSA
## Project overview
Given the price data of two financial instruments X and Y, the goal is to build a model and predict future returns of Y. I analyzed and tested the time series data, built a VAR model and an ARIMA-based VARMA model, and recorded the process in GSA-time-series-forecasting.ipynb.

## Files
- GSA-time-series-forecasting.ipynb: the Jupyter notebook for data analysis of the project.
- solution-py-results.ipynb: Python codes for a VARMA version of my solution. I didn't submit this because it ran overtime on the virtual platform.
- calculate_returns.py: supplementary functions for solution-py-results.ipynb
- tests.py: supplementary functions for solution-py-results.ipynb
